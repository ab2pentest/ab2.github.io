# Description

1) This tool has been used back in 2014 for a CTF Challenge [ASIS-QUALS-2014](http://blog.rentjong.net/2014/05/asis-quals-2014-forensic-300.html)

2) I don't know who's the original tool writer but I found it really interesting so I thought about saving it here in github.

3) Also you must know that this tool use [liblzf](http://cvs.schmorp.de/liblzf/README) library.

```
LZF is an extremely fast (not that much slower than a pure memcpy)
compression algorithm. It is ideal for applications where you want to
save *some* space but not at the cost of speed. It is ideal for
repetitive data as well. The module is self-contained and very small.
```

# Usage:

We first need to clone/download it

```
git clone https://github.com/ab2pentest/VirtualBox_SavedState_Parser
```

After that we have to compile the source code:

```
gcc parsevbox.c lzf_d.c -o parsevbox
gcc extract_screenshot.c -o extract_screenshot
```

After we compile both of files we can run the tool easily in this way:

```bash
./parsevbox date_savedstateimage.sav
```

The process may take several minutes while it decompress the `.sav` file and will drop out some files that we can use later in forensics ...

Great ! We can list out the dropped out files

To extract the screenshot from the output we have a file `*.sav-DisplayScreenshot.out` that we should rename to `vbox.img-DisplayScreenshot.out`
and then we can run `extract_screenshot` tool, this will drop 3 files `out.png`, `out.raw` and `out.ppm`

```bash
mv *.sav-DisplayScreenshot.out vbox.img-DisplayScreenshot.out
./extract_screenshot
```

Now we can preview the `out.png` image file
